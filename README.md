# Practiced Solidity Contracts

Welcome to my collection of practiced Solidity contracts! This repository is a personal project where I explore and demonstrate various Solidity concepts and patterns, following the structured learning path of Dapp University's tutorial series. Whether you're new to Solidity or looking to refresh your skills, feel free to dive into the code and experiment with it.

## Introduction

This repository serves as a practice space where I delve into Solidity, the programming language used for Ethereum smart contracts. The contracts here are based on a structured tutorial, covering everything from basic constructs to advanced features like inheritance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you can run these contracts, you'll need the following:
- Node.js installed on your machine
- Truffle Framework for compiling and deploying contracts
- Ganache for a personal Ethereum blockchain

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
 
   ```
2. Navigate into the repository directory:
   ```
   cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME
   ```
3. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Contracts Overview

Each section of the tutorial is represented as a separate contract or set of contracts in this repository, organized by concepts and features they demonstrate.

### Your First Contract

The journey begins with the creation of a simple contract to understand the basic structure and syntax of Solidity.

### Variables & Data Types

Explores various data types and how to use variables in Solidity, including state variables and local variables.

### Arrays

Introduces arrays, including fixed-size and dynamic arrays, and how to manipulate array elements.

### Mappings

Covers the use of mappings in Solidity, a key-value storage structure for efficiently managing data.

### Conditionals & Loops

Demonstrates the use of conditional statements and loops to control the flow and logic of contracts.

### Full Contract

Puts together the concepts learned into a full-fledged contract, showcasing a practical example of a Solidity application.

### Inheritance

Explores inheritance in Solidity, allowing contracts to inherit properties and functions from other contracts.
